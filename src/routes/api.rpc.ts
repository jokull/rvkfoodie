/**
 * The RPC endpoint, as a TanStack Start SERVER ROUTE.
 *
 * Start's file-based routes carry an optional `server.handlers` record
 * keyed by HTTP method; each handler is `(ctx) => Response`. result-rpc's
 * `createFetchHandler` is a plain `Request => Promise<Response>`, so the
 * adapter is one line.
 *
 * Server-only by construction: `server.handlers` bodies are stripped from
 * the client build, which is why importing ../rpc-server.js (drizzle + D1)
 * here is safe.
